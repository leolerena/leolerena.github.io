<div class="about">
			<h1>About.</h1>
			<p> I'm a pure math licenciate student at the university of Buenos Aires in Argentina. I'm on my final year preparing a thesis and many (many) final exams. At the moment I'm very interested in the intersection of group theory with formal languages theory and the many ways Bass Serre theory rises in more algebraic contexts. Broadly speaking I'm interested in many such things as group theory, geometric group theory, algebraic topology, algebraic combinatorics and theoretical computer science. As you can gather from my description I'm still shaping myself up as a math student (and as a person) and I have many interests even far from mathematics, but that's not for the blog. Mi descripción argenta: En realidad soy un pibe que estudia matemática en UBA y tiene demasiados intereses para su capacidad.
