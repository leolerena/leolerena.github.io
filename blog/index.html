	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	 In this small and rather modest looking blog I want to post things that I think are interesting with as many details as I please. This means that most of what I write falls short from the formal treatments you can find on a textbook or a paper. This is fine. The other side of the coin is that I want it to be interesting and for that reason I want to include many examples and intuitions which I think is the comparative advantage an informal math blog has over a formal book.
	If you want to know what type of math and type of person I am look <a href="/about"> here  </a>. If you want to look at my posts look <a href="/blog"> here
